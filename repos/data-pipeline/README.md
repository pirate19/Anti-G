# Data Pipeline Repository

## Mission
Build resilient ingestion and transformation workflows that consolidate all football and betting-related data sources into trusted datasets for downstream modeling and optimization.

## Scope
- **Source Integration**: Fixtures, historical results, player stats, injuries/suspensions, team news, weather, betting odds, and market limits.
- **Ingestion Modes**: REST APIs, websocket feeds, headless browser scraping, CSV ingestion, third-party webhooks.
- **Processing**: Batch (hourly/daily) and near-real-time pipelines orchestrated via Airflow/Dagster.
- **Data Lakehouse**: Bronze (raw), silver (validated), gold (aggregated) layers with schema evolution support.
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation suites, anomaly detection, latency SLAs, data contract enforcement.

## Proposed Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow or Dagster
- **Storage**: S3/GCS for files, Snowflake/BigQuery/Postgres for structured tables
- **Validation**: Great Expectations, Soda Core
- **Testing**: pytest, dbt tests for transformations
- **Infrastructure**: Dockerized tasks, Kubernetes/ECS deployment

```

## Initial Milestones
1. Finalize list of priority leagues, markets, and bookmakers.
2. Stand up ingestion DAGs for fixtures/results and odds for top leagues.
3. Implement bronzeâ†’silver normalization with schema tests.
4. Automate quality checks and alerting for data latency/missingness.
5. Document data contracts and publish sample datasets for modeling team.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Website Blocking**: Employ rotating proxies, captcha solvers, and fall back to paid APIs.
- **Schema Drift**: Implement contract tests with automated alerts and fallback parsers.
- **Latency**: Prioritize asynchronous scraping and incremental updates to meet pre-match windows.
- **Compliance**: Maintain legal review of scraping activities, respect robots.txt where applicable.
