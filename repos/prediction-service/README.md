# Prediction Service Repository

## Mission
Develop, evaluate, and serve high-accuracy football prediction models that estimate probabilities and distributions for markets used in pre-match and in-play betting.

## Scope
- **Model Portfolio**: Classification (1X2), regression (goal totals), probabilistic models (Poisson, negative binomial), Bayesian hierarchical models, ensemble techniques.
- **Training Pipelines**: Automated workflows that pull curated features, perform preprocessing, training, hyperparameter optimization, and artifact packaging.
- **Evaluation**: Backtesting, calibration analysis, profitability vs. bookmaker odds, uncertainty estimation, and explainability (SHAP/feature importance).
- **Serving**: Real-time inference API, batch scoring jobs, model registry integration, A/B testing framework.
- **Governance**: Model documentation, ethical considerations, compliance with responsible gambling requirements.

## Proposed Stack
- **Languages**: Python 3.11+, optional R modules for advanced stats.
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, PyTorch, PyMC/Stan, Optuna for HPO.
- **Workflow**: MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry, Prefect/Airflow for orchestration.
- **Serving**: FastAPI or BentoML microservices packaged with Docker, deployed on Kubernetes/ECS.
- **Monitoring**: EvidentlyAI, WhyLabs, custom dashboards for calibration and drift.

## Initial Milestones
1. Stand up experiment tracking (MLflow) and baseline logistic regression / gradient boosting models.
2. Implement calibration and profitability evaluation comparing predictions with bookmaker odds.
3. Build automated training pipeline with hyperparameter tuning and artifact versioning.
4. Deploy MVP prediction API returning win/draw/loss probabilities for selected leagues.
5. Add goal distribution modeling to support over/under and Asian handicap markets.

## Risk Management
- **Overfitting**: Use time-based cross-validation, regularization, and model ensembling.
- **Data Leakage**: Enforce strict temporal splits and feature freshness checks.
- **Model Drift**: Monitor performance, trigger retraining workflows, maintain champion/challenger deployments.
- **Explainability**: Provide SHAP summaries and natural language model cards for stakeholders.
