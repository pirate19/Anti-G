# Platform Infrastructure Repository

## Mission
Provide reproducible infrastructure-as-code and DevOps tooling to deploy, monitor, and secure all Anti-G services across environments (dev, staging, production).

## Scope
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Define networking, compute, storage, IAM, and secrets management via Terraform modules.
- **CI/CD**: Centralized pipelines for linting, testing, deployment, and compliance checks across all service repositories.
- **Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing, cost monitoring, and incident response automation.
- **Security & Compliance**: Secret rotation, vulnerability scanning, data retention policies, access controls.
- **MLOps Enablement**: Shared tooling for model registry, artifact storage, and automated retraining triggers.

## Proposed Stack
- **Cloud**: AWS (preferred) with support for GCP/Azure alternatives.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Helm charts, ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with reusable workflows.
- **Secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki/ELK, OpenTelemetry collectors.

## Initial Milestones
1. Provision foundational networking, Kubernetes cluster, and managed database/storage resources via Terraform.
2. Implement CI/CD pipelines with quality gates (linting, tests, security scans) for all repositories.
3. Deploy centralized observability stack with alerting integrations.
4. Define secrets management strategy and implement least-privilege IAM roles.
5. Document deployment runbooks and disaster recovery procedures.

## Governance
- Follow change-management processes with peer review and automated plan/apply workflows.
- Maintain configuration drift detection and compliance audits (e.g., AWS Config, Terraform Cloud policy checks).
- Document architecture decisions (ADRs) and update regularly in the shared `docs/` directory.
