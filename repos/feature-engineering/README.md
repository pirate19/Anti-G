# Feature Engineering Repository

## Mission
Deliver a governed feature store that transforms raw football and betting data into enriched, contextualized features ready for predictive modeling and real-time inference.

## Scope
- **Feature Creation**: Build team-level, player-level, and market-level features capturing form, efficiency, injuries, travel, rest, time-of-day, venue characteristics, and bookmaker signals.
- **Circular & Temporal Modeling**: Encode periodic information (seasonality, match time, rest cycles) using sinusoidal and circular statistics.
- **Feature Management**: Register features with lineage, owners, freshness SLAs, and validation rules.
- **Serving**: Provide both offline datasets for training and online feature APIs for low-latency scoring.
- **Governance**: Track feature usage, monitor drift, and enforce naming conventions and documentation standards.

## Proposed Stack
- **Processing**: Pandas, Polars, Spark (for scale), SQL/dbt for warehouse transformations.
- **Feature Store**: Feast or custom metadata layer backed by Redis/BigQuery/Postgres.
- **Experimentation**: JupyterLab, Databricks, or notebooks with papermill for reproducibility.
- **Validation**: EvidentlyAI for drift, Great Expectations for feature quality.

## Initial Milestones
1. Define feature contracts and taxonomy (naming, owners, refresh cadence).
2. Build team form & efficiency pipeline (rolling xG, Elo, shot quality).
3. Incorporate injury and lineup data with probabilistic availability modeling.
4. Engineer contextual features (rest days, travel distance, pitch type, weather).
5. Publish offline training dataset schema and register features in store.

## Quality & Monitoring
- Validate feature freshness and null rates before publishing.
- Compare model feature importance regularly to prune unused features.
- Track drift metrics and trigger retraining or recalibration when thresholds exceed limits.
