### Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Isolate scraping, feature engineering, modeling, and optimization to scale independently.
- **Reproducibility**: Version datasets, features, and models using MLflow/Weights & Biases plus a metadata catalog.
- **Observability**: Collect logs, metrics, traces, and data-quality alerts across every service.
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails for data sourcing and betting decisions; enforce access controls and encryption.

## Components

### Data Pipeline (`repos/data-pipeline`)
- **Sources**: League fixtures/results APIs, Opta/StatsBomb data, weather feeds, injury reports, bookmaker odds.
- **Ingestion**: Mix of REST polling, websocket listeners, and headless browser scrapers with proxy rotation.
- **Processing**: Orchestrated via Airflow or Dagster, writing bronze→silver→gold layers in cloud storage + data warehouse.
- **Quality**: Great Expectations or Soda for validation, with alerts to Slack/PagerDuty.

### Feature Engineering (`repos/feature-engineering`)
- **Feature Layers**: Team form (Elo, rolling xG), player efficiency, squad availability, schedule congestion, venue/turf, referee tendencies.
- **Circular Features**: Represent seasonality/time-of-day via sin/cos transforms, encode rest cycles and tournament phases.
- **Serving**: Feast or custom feature store with offline store (Parquet/BigQuery) and online store (Redis/DynamoDB).
- **Analytics**: Provide notebooks/dashboards for feature discovery and hypothesis testing.

### Prediction Service (`repos/prediction-service`)
- **Modeling Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch for neural nets, PyMC/Stan for Bayesian models.
- **Targets**: Match outcome probabilities, goal distributions (Poisson/negative binomial), player props.
- **Evaluation**: Cross-validation by season, calibration curves, Brier/log-loss, profitability vs. implied odds.
- **Deployment**: MLflow or Sagemaker endpoints, with Dockerized microservices exposing REST/gRPC APIs.

### Betting Optimizer (`repos/betting-optimizer`)
- **Odds Scraping**: Scrapy/Playwright-based collectors with redundancy across bookmakers.
- **Edge Engine**: Compare predicted win probabilities vs. odds, account for bookmaker margin (overround) and market liquidity.
- **Optimization**: Mixed-integer programming (PuLP/OR-Tools) for combinatorial tickets, reinforcement learning for dynamic staking.
- **Risk Management**: Bankroll allocation (Kelly variants), stop-loss/take-profit rules, compliance logging.

### Platform Infrastructure (`repos/platform-infra`)
- **IaC**: Terraform modules for networking, compute (EKS/GKE), data warehouse, storage, secrets manager.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI pipelines with automated testing, linting, and deployment gates.
- **Observability**: Prometheus/Grafana, ELK/Opensearch, OpenTelemetry tracing, cost monitoring.
- **Security**: SSO integration, secret rotation, vulnerability scanning, dependency management.

## Data Management Strategy
- **Storage**: Raw data in object storage (S3/GCS); structured data in warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Postgres).
- **Cataloging**: Use DataHub or Amundsen to document datasets, lineage, and ownership.
- **Versioning**: DVC or LakeFS for dataset version control; Git LFS for large artifacts if required.
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with least privilege, encryption at rest and in transit.

## Modeling Best Practices
- Use hierarchical and contextual models to capture team-level and player-level interactions.
- Incorporate market-derived priors (implied probabilities) as calibration baselines.
- Perform backtesting with rolling windows and scenario-based simulations (injuries, schedule congestion).
- Maintain champion/challenger setup with automated A/B evaluation and fallback mechanisms.

## Betting Strategy Best Practices
- Quantify edge vs. bookmaker margin before recommending bets.
- Diversify tickets across leagues and bet types to manage correlation risk.
- Enforce responsible gambling thresholds and compliance checks per jurisdiction.
- Integrate alerting for odds movement and limit changes.

## Operational Processes
- **Incident Response**: On-call rotation, runbooks, postmortems.
- **Data/Model Governance**: Approval workflows for new data sources and models, documenting assumptions and limitations.
- **Compliance Audits**: Regular reviews of data sourcing agreements and betting recommendations.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loops from bettors, profitability metrics, model drift detection.
