# Delivery Roadmap

This roadmap breaks the Anti-G program into four phases with iterative milestones. Each milestone produces tangible assets (datasets, services, or decision support tools) that unlock value while de-risking later stages.

## Phase 0 – Discovery & Foundations (Weeks 1-4)

### Objectives
- Define supported competitions, betting markets, and regulatory constraints.
- Validate data providers (official APIs, open data, injury feeds, odds sources) and negotiate access.
- Establish governance: security, compliance, data retention, responsible gambling policies.

### Key Deliverables
- Requirements brief and compliance checklist.
- Proof-of-concept data ingestion notebooks validating coverage and latency.
- Infrastructure decision log (cloud provider, orchestration, secret management, database).
- Hiring or contractor plan for data engineers, ML engineers, quant analysts, and DevOps.

## Phase 1 – Data Platform MVP (Weeks 5-10)

### Objectives
- Implement automated ingestion for match schedules, historical results, player stats, injuries, weather, and bookmaker odds.
- Stand up bronze (raw) → silver (validated) → gold (analytical) data layers with metadata and lineage tracking.
- Deliver analytics-ready datasets to unblock modeling work.

### Key Deliverables
- Airflow or Dagster pipelines for each data source with monitoring and alerting.
- Data quality suite covering schema drift, missingness, latency, and outliers.
- Normalized database schema (e.g., Snowflake/Postgres/BigQuery) and storage policy for raw files.
- Documentation for data contracts and API usage.

## Phase 2 – Prediction & Evaluation MVP (Weeks 11-18)

### Objectives
- Build feature pipeline capturing form, efficiency metrics, circular contexts (time-of-season, rest days), weather, and team sheets.
- Train baseline models (e.g., gradient boosting, probabilistic neural nets, Bayesian models) for primary markets (1X2, over/under, BTTS).
- Evaluate calibration against bookmaker implied probabilities; identify mispricing windows.

### Key Deliverables
- Feature store with serving APIs and offline training materialization.
- Automated experimentation framework with cross-validation, backtesting, and feature importance reporting.
- Model registry with versioning, metrics, and deployment hooks.
- Bias and fairness report ensuring adherence to responsible AI standards.

## Phase 3 – Betting Optimization & Ticket Generation (Weeks 19-26)

### Objectives
- Implement live odds scrapers with rate limiting, captcha mitigation, and compliance logging.
- Build edge detection service to compare predicted probabilities vs. bookmaker odds, including margin adjustments.
- Design bankroll management strategies (Kelly, fractional Kelly, risk parity) and staking rules.
- Generate bet slips optimized for ROI, turnover requirements, and risk exposure.

### Key Deliverables
- Odds ingestion microservice with persistence and alerting.
- Optimization engine (linear/integer programming or heuristic search) for ticket construction.
- Simulation suite for scenario analysis and stress testing.
- Web dashboard or API delivering recommended bets with audit trail.

## Phase 4 – Scale, Automation & Continuous Improvement (Weeks 27+)

### Objectives
- Harden infrastructure with autoscaling, CI/CD, observability, and failover.
- Introduce reinforcement learning or dynamic programming for in-play betting strategies.
- Expand market coverage (player props, corners, cards) and multi-sport support.
- Monitor profitability, model drift, and compliance; iterate based on feedback loops.

### Key Deliverables
- Full production monitoring stack (metrics, logs, traces) and anomaly detection alerts.
- Automated retraining and deployment workflows triggered by data freshness or performance thresholds.
- Post-deployment review cadence with KPIs, profitability dashboards, and compliance sign-off.
- Backlog of R&D initiatives prioritized by expected ROI.

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams

- **Data Governance**: Data catalog, access controls, anonymization where necessary.
- **MLOps**: Reproducible training pipelines, artifact tracking, experiment management.
- **Risk & Compliance**: Adherence to gambling regulations, anti-money laundering checks, user protection mechanisms.
- **Product & UX**: Feedback from bettors, interface design for dashboards or APIs, localization.

## Milestone Acceptance Criteria

Each phase completes when:
1. All defined deliverables are deployed to staging or production environments.
2. Documentation and runbooks are published and peer reviewed.
3. Success metrics (accuracy, latency, uptime, ROI targets) meet agreed thresholds.
4. Stakeholders sign off during governance review.
